# vim-spell

Syntax specific spell files

I like keeping spell check on, however, often times, I'll use a word specific to
the language I'm using in a comment which isn't a valid English word. This will
cause vim to mark it as a mis-spelling. For example, if I use the word "const"
in a c/c++ comment, vim will mark it. vim-spell works around this annoyance by
providing syntax specific spelling files and loading them as needed.
