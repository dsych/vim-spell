# vim-spell

Syntax specific spell files

I like keeping spell check on, however there are a few problems with that:

1. Often times, I'll use a word specific to the language I'm using in
   a comment which isn't a valid English word. This will cause vim to
   mark it as a mis-spelling. For example, if I use the word "const"
   in a c/c++ comment, vim will mark it. vim-spell works around this
   annoyance by providing syntax specific spelling files and loading
   them as needed.

2. When I use a word that is a project specific identifier, vim marks
   it as a mis-spelling as well. For example, if I were to define a
   class called "MyVector", it would be marked as a mis-spelling if I
   were to use it in a comment.

This plugin solves these issues by:

1. Providing languages specific word lists and spell files
2. Allowing the user to create a spell file from tags file
